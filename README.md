### You made it! Hi I'm Seth.

A little about me:

I love coding. Even the frustrating parts are still enjoyable. I love learning, my main goal with coding is to never stop learning.
 
 
I also love open source, the idea of community built products that anyone can use is such a beautiful idea to me. 

Some non coding stuff about me: 

I enjoy most physical activities, from lifting weights to running to rock climbing and snowboarding. I love working with my hands as well, building computers, wood working, auto repair, even digging holes and mixing concrete can be fun.

I have 2 dogs, 2 cats, 2 bunnies, and 10 chickens.

I also very much enjoy playing video games, and I have a sizeable collection of older titles too. If we are ever in a zoom call you will most likely spot it in the background :)
  
My favorite game is Super Smash Bros Melee. I have played the game competitively since 2015, and gone to a handful tournaments as well.
